## Developing a custom ruleset

osu! is designed to allow user-created gameplay variations, called "rulesets". Building one of these allows a developer to harness the power of the osu! beatmap library, game engine, and general UX for a new style of gameplay. To get started working on a ruleset, we have some templates available [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/tree/master/Templates).

You can see some examples of custom rulesets by visiting the [custom ruleset directory](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions/13096).

## Developing osu!

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) and [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) plugin installed.

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu
cd osu
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the `osu` directory:

```shell
git pull
```

### Building

#### From an IDE

You should load the solution via one of the platform-specific `.slnf` files, rather than the main `.sln`. This will reduce dependencies and hide platforms that you don't care about. Valid `.slnf` files are:

- `osu.Desktop.slnf` (most common)
- `osu.Android.slnf`
- `osu.iOS.slnf`

Run configurations for the recommended IDEs (listed above) are included. You should use the provided Build/Run functionality of your IDE to get things going. When testing or building new components, it's highly encouraged you use the `osu! (Tests)` project/configuration. More information on this is provided [below](#contributing).

To build for mobile platforms, you will likely need to run `sudo dotnet workload restore` if you haven't done so previously. This will install Android/iOS tooling required to complete the build.

#### From CLI

You can also build and run *osu!* from the command-line with a single command:

```shell
dotnet run --project osu.Desktop
```

When running locally to do any kind of performance testing, make sure to add `-c Release` to the build command, as the overhead of running with the default `Debug` configuration can be large (especially when testing with local framework modifications as below).

If the build fails, try to restore NuGet packages with `dotnet restore`.

### Testing with resource/framework modifications

Sometimes it may be necessary to cross-test changes in [osu-resources](https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources) or [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). This can be quickly achieved using included commands:

Windows:

```ps
UseLocalFramework.ps1
UseLocalResources.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

```ps
UseLocalFramework.sh
UseLocalResources.sh
```

Note that these commands assume you have the relevant project(s) checked out in adjacent directories:

```
|- osu            // this repository
|- osu-framework
|- osu-resources
```

### Code analysis

Before committing your code, please run a code formatter. This can be achieved by running `dotnet format` in the command line, or using the `Format code` command in your IDE.

We have adopted some cross-platform, compiler integrated analyzers. They can provide warnings when you are editing, building inside IDE or from command line, as-if they are provided by the compiler itself.

JetBrains ReSharper InspectCode is also used for wider rule sets. You can run it from PowerShell with `.\InspectCode.ps1`. Alternatively, you can install ReSharper or use Rider to get inline support in your IDE of choice.
